UPDATE NOTES:

*	In order to achieve a better look, please install the Post Processing Stack from the packange manager,
	and setup a gloobal post prcessing vlume using provided post processing profiles.

*	Previously, the "First Person Controller" which is included in the Unity's "Standard Assets" pack was used which was dependent on other scripts and assets !
	In v4.0 the same controller was taken and simplified in order to remove dependencies on other assets and systems like "CrossPlatformInput" and fov kick and camera bobbing scripts,
	part of the same "Standard Assets" package. The current provided "SimpleFPSController" is meant to be used only for examine the demo project.
	Be sure to integrate another advanced FPS controller for you project !

	NOTES : you can delete the "CrossPlatformInput" and Utility ( they should be added int othe Misc folder ) folders if you upgrade from v3.0 and previous
	as you do not need them anymore!



Notes:

*	Be sure to switch to Linear mode for correct scene look !

*	Decals are using standard shader and are not using any kind of decal shaders with blend.
	If you own a decal system or have decal shaders you can switch to it.
	Water decals are simply Standard(Specular setup) shader with high specular values.

*	Add any kind of grunge texture to the Detail slot of the Standard shader of walls etc. for even more aged look.

*	Be sure to enable shadows, only for the most importnant lights.
	Proper lights setup is a key for good looking and performing scene. Having many overlapping lights is expensive.

*	You can place more area lights for lightmap baking instead of relying on point lights only
	in order to lit up any darker area.

	! IMPORTANT NOTE !

*	Prefabs are NOT flagged as "Batching static" in order for material instanting to be used.
	However materials are not having the option enabled by defaule simply because there is 
	something about the hardware i am using which actually decreases performance.

	So, be sure to go and enable instancing for objects you decide and keep it if it gives performance
	improvements fot you.

	For exampla, pipes should be perfect for using instancing because they are composed by separate parts !
